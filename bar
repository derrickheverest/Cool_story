Are you a robot when it comes to decision making?
If you are a robot, you pay attention to probability.  If the probability is high, then you the robot will go ahead and start doing that thing.  however, when you add the human element to it, things change.

There was a movie staring will smith that presented this delema quite clearly.  it was a movie titled, iRobot.  In that movie, will smith is stuck in a car and it is filling up with water.  His is sinking into a large body of water.  There is another car in the near distance containing a young girl.  Fighting to get out.  And for those of you that don't know.  it is really really really hard to break glass when there is a large body of water behind it.  You would have to wait until water is on both sides of the glass before it is humanly possible for you to break the glass.

A humanoid robot appears and goes to save will smith.  Mr smith shouts at the robot, telling him to skip him and just save the girl!  The robot refuses and just saves mr smith and leaves the girl to drown.

The reason the robot did not save the girl?  

Probability.

The Smith had a probability of survival of 60 percent, while the girl had a 3% chance of succesfully being saved.  3 per cent.  3 percent was the reason the robot did not even bother to try.

Fellow toast masters.... is three percent stoping you from trying?

We are humans.  And as illogical as it may be...part of what makes us human is that 3 percent.  Humans are willing to take that 3 percent chance.
